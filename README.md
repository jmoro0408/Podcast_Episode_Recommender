# Podcast_Episode_Recommender

So you loved that Stuff You Should Know (SYSK) episode on <i>The Dyatlov Pass Mystery</i>, and want to know which other episodes Josh and chuck have that might be similar? Well with over 1500 episodes, it can be hard to choose.

This project uses latent dirichlet allocation (LDA), a natural language processing (NLP) technique, to analyse topics within SYSK episodes and provide similar episode recommendations.

Current a work in progress.
